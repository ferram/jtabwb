# jtabwb
Java Tableau Workbench
----------------------


JTabWb is a Java framework for developing provers based on sequent or
tableau calculi. It provides a generic engine which searches for the
proof of a goal driven by a user-defined prover. The user is required
to define the components of a prover by implementing suitable Java
interfaces.

JTabWb requires Java 1.8 or later.
