# jtabwb
Java Tableau Workbench


JTabWb is a Java framework for developing provers based on sequent or
tableau calculi. It provides a generic engine which searches for
proof of a given goal driven by a user-defined prover. The user is
required to define the components of a prover by implementing
suitable Java interfaces.

JTabWb requires Java 1.8 or later. Download the jtabwb-1.0.jar file
and add it to your CLASSPATH.
